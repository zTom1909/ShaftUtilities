## ShaftUtilities
**Shaft Utilities** is a simple yet useful mod for mineshaft parties inside the glacial tunnels, it allows players to automatically announce new mineshafts in party chat, transfer the party to those who found a mineshaft, find corpses and an option to quickly warp out of a mineshaft after finding a scrap!
- Use **/su help** to get started!
### Installation
